# Snake Game in Pygame

A classic Snake game built using Pygame. The objective of the game is to control the snake, eat the food, and avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake eats more food, it grows in length, making the game more challenging.

## Features
- **Simple controls**: Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to navigate the snake.
- **Increasing difficulty**: The snake grows in length as it eats food, making it harder to avoid collisions.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
- **Score display**: The player's score increases with each piece of food eaten.
